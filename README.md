## Rehost
- Move as-is while minimizing change
## Replatform
- Involve updates solution components(OS, middleware, DBs)

## Refactor
- Big change to solution architecture and codebase

## Rearchitect
- Rebuild App on a cloud-native app stack
- Change the way a piece of code works

## Replace
- **Retire** old and dev new App from new requirements and technology
- Can involve SaaS solutions

## Repurchase
- **drop and shop**: decommissioning the application and replacing it with a cloud-based version
- typically on the Cloud Marketplace.
- Effectively, this is a licensing changeâ€”instead of using a traditional on-premise license, you can start using the same application as a cloud service.

## Retain
- "In many cases, during a migration project you can identify applications that are redundant or to be consolidated"
- Shut the redundant down can represent a cost saving.
